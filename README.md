## Awesome Flutter Showcase

Flutter is Google’s mobile app SDK for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

This is just me curating interesting unofficial demo flutter repositories i find on github and that can't make it into the [#awesome-flutter](https://github.com/Solido/awesome-flutter) master branch, no tutorials links.
